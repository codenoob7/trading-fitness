## Detailed Evidence

### V1: Directory Structure

```bash
# Command: find . -type f | wc -l
# Result: 180+ files in structure

# Gap Analysis - 11 files were MISSING:
# - README.md (created)
# - targets.json (created)
# - docs/LOGGING.md (created)
# - scripts/affected.sh (created)
# - services/data-ingestion/CLAUDE.md (created)
# - services/strategy-engine/CLAUDE.md (created)
# - services/execution-gateway/CLAUDE.md (created)
# - skills/python/SKILL.md (created)
# - skills/rust/SKILL.md (created)
# - skills/bun/SKILL.md (created)
# - packages/shared-types/CLAUDE.md (created)
```

### V2: Config Files

```bash
# mise.toml: SSoT for runtime versions (see mise.toml for actual versions)
# - Tasks: lint, test, analyze, affected

# .mcp.json: MCP servers configured
# - mise mcp
# - ck-search (code-search)
# - ast-grep mcp

# sgconfig.yml: ast-grep rules configured
# - ruleDirs: rules/{general,python,rust,typescript}

# .gitignore: Proper exclusions
# - artifacts/, logs/, __pycache__/, target/, node_modules/
```

### V3: ith-python Package

```bash
# Command: uv run python -c "from ith_python.paths import get_data_dir; print(get_data_dir())"
# Result: /Users/terryli/eon/trading-fitness/data

# Fix Applied: pyproject.toml was missing [build-system] section
# Added hatchling build-backend and wheel package configuration
```

### V4: Placeholder Packages

```bash
# core-rust:
# Command: cargo check
# Result: Finished `dev` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s)

# core-bun:
# Command: bun --eval "console.log('OK')"
# Result: core-bun OK
```

### V5: Data Migration

```bash
# suresh.csv:
# Command: wc -l data/nav_data_custom/suresh.csv
# Result: 2727 lines, 97089 bytes

# Artifacts:
# Command: find artifacts -type f | wc -l
# Result: 155 files (76 CSV + 78 HTML + .gitkeep)
```

### V6: Documentation

```bash
# Command: ls docs/
# Result: ARCHITECTURE.md, ITH.md, LOGGING.md, VERIFICATION.md

# CLAUDE.md exists at repo root
```

### V7: E2E Test

```bash
# Command: mise run analyze
# Result:
# - Project directories initialized
# - 15 existing qualified results processed
# - 1 custom CSV processed (suresh.csv)
# - Results saved to artifacts/results.html
# - Browser opened successfully
```

### V8: Git & Archives

```bash
# Git state:
# Command: git log --oneline -5
# Result: 2 commits on main branch

# Archive location:
# Path: ~/archive/ith-fitness-backup-20260115/
# Contents: Documents-ith-fitness/, Library-ith-fitness/
```

## Fix-Forward Actions

| Issue                      | Root Cause                               | Fix                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ModuleNotFoundError        | Missing [build-system] in pyproject.toml | Added hatchling config |
| 11 missing files           | Incomplete implementation                | Created all files      |
| requires-python too strict | Copied from test env                     | Relaxed constraint     |

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Quick health check
cd ~/eon/trading-fitness
mise run analyze          # Should complete without errors
uv run pytest             # Should pass (if tests exist)
cargo check               # Should succeed
bun --eval "console.log('OK')"  # Should print OK
```
